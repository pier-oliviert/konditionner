// I would love to have tests here, but since the Lock interacts with a Kubernetes client
// the amount of mocking to get a test up and running is borderline crazy. Until I find a way to get
// a solid testsuite running for the lock, this will remain empty, unfortunately.
//
// I'm hoping to find a library that can easily work with kubernetes mocks or I find enough time
// to build a suite that makes it possible to run different scenarios with sane expectations.
